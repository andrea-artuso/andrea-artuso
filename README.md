### Hi everybody ðŸ‘‹
My name is Andrea, I was born in Borgosesia (VC) and I have always lived in Varallo (VC).
I fell in love with IT when I was eleven years old. I started to learn coding basics and programming fundamentals.
Now I'm studyng IT in Novara and I'm in the second year.
After graduate, I want to enroll in the Computer Engineering class at the university.

Currently, I develop website as a freelancer.

I love working in team and get involved in new projects. I'm a creative thinker and problem solver.

Aside from IT and professional career, I like aviation, design and space exploration. I love listening to music while I work, especially Italian pop music.
